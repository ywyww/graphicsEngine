======================= TODO =======================
[ ] throw event into controller, here he can handle event information (and Renderer will not consist of controller functions)
[ ] turn drawLines from Controller into the Renderer class
[ ] подумать над сигнальной архитектурой
[ ] refactoring: function from renderer to controller.
[ ] fix rotation function
[ ] write info in special files, not in code 
[ ] add keyboard input to controll the lines

[ ] polyline mode (add different objects pallete)

[ ] upload button
[ ] save button
[ ] copy & past buttons

[ ] make own class for each type x - glRenderArea.xof objects
[ ] make structure for Controller`s objects 

[ ] fix point belong function: one line overlaps another
[ ] fix point belong function: add transformation data into coordinates
[ ] if x1 == x2 or y1 == y2 in LineBelongFunction, it isn`t work
[ ] make unified transformation coordinates

[ ] make different threads for computing and rendering
[ ] make events for sending value to the status bar | now just a problem to rapid transmission of information / log bar
[ ] make a logger

[ ] camera class
[ ] do dynamic coordinates (dynamic VBO)

[ ] make polyline as std::vector of Lines class

[ ] refactoring: divide controller class on sub-classes. It has too many functions
[ ] refactoring: turn line coordinates (x_n, y_n) to the controller class
[ ] refactoring: long width chain: see Line->Controller->Renderer->main (width and height);
[ ] refactoring: new names
[ ] refactoring hard code: main.cpp: belongX while belongWindow
[ ] refactoring hard code: Line.cpp: renderWindowWidth and renderWindowHeight
 
[ ] refactoring: xml other enum with stringss
[ ] optimize code: make areas without render
[ ] drawSceneTree: fix Object->Line inheritance
======================= TODO ======================= 

======================= DONE ======================= 
[x] make maps static
[x] changement for current node (menu)
[x] do basic interaction with lines
[x] global coordinates into view coordinates
[x] add tip feature: when cursor on the object, it`s show it`s name
[x] do something with incapsulation: controller and renderer class are callable from main loop. (but controller lying in renderer) 
[x] make delete button
[x] refactoring: work with controller inside a controller, not outside in renderer class
[x] fix LineInputData: don`t work.  // возможно крашится из-за динамик каста.
[x] delete nodeGroup template -> make just Node with Object pointer.
[x] enum with modes
[x] add color change in line settings
[x] button for enum to change modes
[x] active node (scene mode)
[x] fix lineName change function
[x] turn belong window to the status bar.
[x] fix object chose.
[x] add class member lineName in LineInputData class
[x] delete Scene class and turn its data to Controller;
[x] add point belong function (not working correctly)
[x] fix status bar render  
[x] object class
[x] divide renderer class to the controller class and renderer
[x] trim gl coordinates (loop)
[x] put sizes into variables (refactoring)
[x] do SDL rect for polling glViewport data.
[x] подумать над машиной состояний, которая будет следить и управлять за каждым объектом
[x] do coordinate transformation
[x] add trimCoordinates (glScissors) in variables (height, width, shifts)
[x] add window dimensions in variables (height, width)
[x] add recalculator for trimmed coordinates;
[x] scene not in main loop. put scene into controller or renderer
======================= DONE ======================= 


======================= NONE ======================= 
[-] radiobutton for enum to change modes
[-] make 3d capable for isPointBelong function: Line class
[-] make unique coefficients for each object to infinity transformations flag (in scene tree)
[-] make sceneRenderer class for render gl data: division GUI renderer and GL renderer
[-] coordinateFormatter to create objects in absolute coordinates (not above window size and height)
======================= NONE =======================
